A network device monitoring tool that pings specified IP addresses to check the status of devices in real-time. The tool sends email and desktop notifications, along with alert sounds, when a device goes offline or comes back online. It leverages threading for concurrent monitoring and ensures a graceful shutdown upon user interruption. This project is designed to provide continuous and automated monitoring of critical network devices, offering real-time alerts and status tracking to ensure network reliability.
